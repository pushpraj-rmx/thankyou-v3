**Thankyou Mattresses & More**

The company **Thankyou Mattresses & More** was established in the year 1995 by a team of experienced and professionally qualified family members.

After having created their niche in the commercial market, hotels, hostels, hospitals, and railways, the management, over time, emphasized and felt the need to develop and enter the arena of “DIRECT MARKETING NETWORK” (DMN) in the year 2012, so that existing and new customers could benefit to the maximum in a highly competitive market. Customers can get the *right value for their money* for the type and price range of the mattress they desire, while comparing the quality, warranty, and prices with the best super brands.

The company proposed to promote the DMN strategy in such a way as to give maximum benefits and maintain life-long direct relationships with its customers.

**CUSTOMER BE AWARE:**

Customers should be aware that *nothing is truly free* — free gifts, big discounts, and exchange of old mattresses are generally eye-wash tactics. The price of the product is often increased or exaggerated, and then big discounts and gifts are offered.

**KEY POINTS TO NOTE:**

- Our prices for mattresses are designed to give you the best quality and warranty compared to super-branded product prices.
- We don’t use any plastic filler in our mattresses, which obstructs the free flow of air and is often used as a cost-saving alternative by many manufacturers. Such materials are generally harmful to health.
- The thickness of the mattresses stated includes the thickness used in the inner block of the mattress, as well as the PU foam thickness used in the quilted cover.
- The thickness of mattress models can be increased or decreased according to the height of the bed, and the cost will adjust accordingly. However, the change in cost may not be proportional.
- Each model’s thickness cost may differ, and a quotation can be provided.
- Mattress configurations can be altered on request according to the customer's requirements, with an adjusted price quotation provided.
- There is a reasonable choice of different colors available for mattress fabrics.
